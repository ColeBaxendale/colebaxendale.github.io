        <h2>Artifacts</h2>
        <div class="artifact">
            <h3>Software Design and Engineering:</h3>
            <p><span class="sub-heading">Description:</span>The original project was a web scraping application created using Java, with a JavaFX frontend and serialization for data storage. Developed during my intermediate years in the Computer Science program, this project aimed to automate data extraction from websites, presenting it through a graphical user interface. Recognizing its potential but also its limitations, I transformed this project into a full-stack web application, leveraging Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, Angular, and Express. This enhancement was completed in the latter part of my program as a capstone project, symbolizing a significant leap in my software development journey.</p>
            <p><span class="sub-heading">Justification for Inclusion:</span>This artifact represents a profound evolution in my approach to software design and engineering. The transition from a Java-based desktop application to a full-stack web application showcases my adaptability and growth in software development. By selecting this item for my ePortfolio, I highlight my ability to not only conceive and develop applications across different platforms but also my commitment to leveraging modern technologies to solve complex problems more efficiently.</p>
            <p><span class="sub-heading">Reflection on the Process:</span>Enhancing this project taught me the importance of scalable software architecture and the power of full-stack development in creating dynamic, responsive applications. I faced challenges in learning new technologies and rethinking the application's design to make it web-based. Incorporating feedback from peers and mentors was crucial in refining the user interface and enhancing the application's functionality. This process underscored the significance of continuous learning, user-centric design, and the implementation of secure, efficient back-end operations. The project was vastly improved, offering a more interactive, user-friendly experience and robust data management capabilities.</p>
